                    Granni moves closer to his brother in Boston's Italian North End neighborhood. He embraces his Italian identity, becoming an active member of parish life at St. Leonard's Church and joining the local Order of the Sons of Italy in America Chapter. His involvement in church and business circles within the city's Italian community help his ambitions to own his own fishmongers business.

You have become friends with Li Jie, a fellow Cantonese immigrant who moved to California with his parents as a child.

He writes to ask Li Jie to come help and to bring a few laborers with him. It’s risky, but potentially profitable.

                            <p><b>1889</b>. When Washington achieves statehood in 1889, its constitution it includes a statute that prevents those ineligible for citizenship from owning property. Wang Jie can not continue to own Rivera and Co.’s property. While they could sell to a cooperative white business connection and remain in the building as a tenant, Wang Jie has finally realised how difficult it is to do business in such a hostile environment. He shutters Rivera & Son’s Seattle office, and you return to San Francisco.</p>

You have finally saved enough money to travel back to China and to pay for a return trip for your family of three, but in the meantime, the Chinese Exclusion Act is passed in 1882, barring from entry all Chinese skilled and unskilled laborers. As an already resident laborer, you could leave the US and return if you got a readmission certificate, but you’re aware that because of hostility towards the Chinese these laws are being made more restrictive all the time. You fear that the law will change again and you won’t be able to return. Your separation from your family is now indefinite.</p>

You attend the Irish parish of St. Patrick’s where you meet people from your home county of Tipperary. In 1862, Louis becomes a citizen. As his wife, you are naturalized automatically. Although this doesn’t affect your daily life, it gives you a sense of pride and belonging, which you think is particularly important given the ongoing tumult of Civil War. After some years, your brother and his family relocate to Chicago, and you feel more settled, striking a balance between life in the Irish and German immigrant communities.</p>

                            <p><b>1858</b>. You meet John O’Leary, a tailor from County Cork. At 45, John is significantly older than you and it is not a romantic relationship, but he offers you companionship and, with steady employment at a Manhattan drapery, the chance to leave the drudgery of the textile factory behind. You are an attractive match because of the dowry you bring with your savings as a ladies maid. You marry and establish yourself in an apartment large enough to provide a home for your three younger siblings. John acquires citizenship in 1860. His naturalization means that you, automatically and unceremoniously, become a citizen too.</p>

After attending a presentation in Accra by an American nursing recruitment agency, you signed a contract promising to secure a visa and the ability to work as a nurse. The entire process took just over a year, and the visa application alone required multiple trips to the U.S. Embassy in Accra, a rigorous medical exam, many vaccinations, and a seemingly interminable collection of certificates and transcripts. Now at last, you are arriving in Newark, New Jersey, to take up your contracted post at a children’s hospital in New Brunswick.</p>

Awesi is now a happy eight year-old who loves school and her friends, but it pains you that she knows so little about her heritage. You received your nursing license in 2001 and have worked long hours to pay for your naturalization and the $4,000 in fees required to secure your mother’s permanent residency. Finally, almost a decade after you left her behind, your mother has arrived to live with you. You hope her presence will enrich your daughter’s life and foster a love for your homeland.</p>

You have been happily married for nine years with a son, Kofi, a daughter, Awesi, and a job that you love in Pediatric Oncology at Children’s National Hospital. You see Paul’s father very rarely, but his mother[f] maintains close contact and showers your children with affection. You acquired citizenship soon after you married, and immediately applied to bring your mother to live with you. The process cost almost $4,000, but you could afford it and were able to prove that you had sufficient resources to support a dependent mother. In late 2002, five years after you left her alone in Ghana, you are reunited with your mother.</p>

The guidance counsellor, Mr. Wu, helped another undocumented student get into a Chicago-area college a few years ago.

It may be some time before the law changes, if it happens at all, but it gives you hope that you might achieve legal status some day. <span data-boldspan> You agree to talk to Mr. Wu. </span></p>

You have very little of the kind of concrete evidence that you’ll need as proof of a legitimate marriage (a joint bank account, lease, photographs of your life together), and the fact that you are undocumented will make your fast marriage look all the more suspicious.</p>

In June, after years of Congressional inaction on the DREAM bill, President Obama makes the announcement you thought would never happen. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) is designed for people like you: an undocumented who arrived in the U.S. under the age of 16 and before 2007, has graduated high school, and has no serious criminal convictions. But you are apprehensive: this will mean registering with the authorities. You’re aware that Republicans oppose Obama’s policy. What if they reverse DACA some day and deport those who registered?</p>

You meet a man who tells you that there are ways to find work in the U.S. that don’t require a contract. Your know that this type of illegal work means lower wages and poorer conditions, but it’s still more than you would earn in Mexico.</p>

                            <p>You are working illegally on a large cotton plantation east of Laredo owned by Edward Wilson.

The foreman tells you that $1.25 will be deducted from your wage each week for the transportation to Texas. It takes longer than you expected for your debt to be paid off. Wilson offers to keep you and the other undocumented workers on through the winter months and into the new planting season.</p>

In order to secure approval, you have to travel over 1,000 miles to Chihuahua. While there are plenty of contracts, there are even more men hoping to secure one. You’ve heard that some men are waiting at reception centers for up to ten days before being seen.

Nevertheless, the money is better than what you would earn in Mexico. The U.S. immigration authorities are raiding workplaces across the country as part of “Operation Wetback” and you are picked up.

While there, you spend more time with Avila, a woman you have known since childhood. You fall in love and consider marriage. It’s a harder decision than it should be: you must continue to work in U.S. to support your parents. A wife and, in time, children would be another draw on your wages. There’s also the question of whether Avila would come with you. If you left her at home, you would miss her terribly, but you’ve seen families on the seasonal farm laborer circuit and it’s a hard life.</p>

                            <p><b>2018</b>. Since receiving TPS, Óscar’s life has been transformed. He attended UCLA and is now an EMT. In 2009, he married Katie, a U.S. citizen, and they live nearby with their son, Arturo. After marrying, Óscar got permanent resident status. Though he had to return to El Salvador to apply for his green card, as a TPS holder he was able to leave and return to the U.S. In 2014, he became a citizen. Now, 36 years after you arrived, you’re resigned to undocumented status. All you can do is trust that your son will provide for you and the shadows will keep you hidden.</p>
